# Instructions
The objective is to design a video sharing and streaming platform; a Youtube "clone". The functional and non-functional requirments are not set in stone, we expect you to decide by yourself what requirements a "good" video streaming and sharing platform should have. Obviously a platform like Youtube can have countless features, so a focus on just core functionality such as uploading and viewing videos is expected, but if you find value in expanding or contracting the scope, feel free to do so. You are expected to spend 30 minutes presenting and defending your proposed architecture in the upcoming interview, and will also be expected to submit specific deliverables by pushing them to a Github repository before the deadline. In particular, the expected deliverables are:

### Mandatory deliverables
- [ ] A Diagram illustrating your proposed system
- [ ] What technologies/languages you would use within each component of the system. (Is the Database PostgreSQL or MongoDB? Would you use Express or Flask to develop the API?)
- [ ] A React application acting as the front page of your Youtube clone. This page must contain a scrollable list of videos with titles and thumbnails. This page does not need to actually be functional, clicking on the videos does not need to do anything.

### Bonus points
- [ ] Any functionality added to your front page React app, for example:
  * Adding the ability for a user to "favorite" a video, and persisting a list of a user's "favorited" videos.
  * Adding the ability for a user to click on a video and watch it
  * **Feel free to decide on your own what features you could add that would be a good exhibition of your abilites**
- [ ] An API spec for any API's included in your proposed system. This would include:
  * A description of all available endpoints
  * The request and response types for each endpoint
  * Anything else you think is worth providing as documentation to someone planning on using this API
- [ ] Prototypes of any other service included in your system. For example:
  * A Database and API that your React app uses to fetch and persist data
 
### What you will be assessed on
This is a relatively open-ended assessment, and we want you to feel free to design and build whatever you think best displays your abilities. We will expect that you can develop a simple React App, and that you can design a system given basic business requirements. Everything else is optional, but appreciated. **Please fork this repository, and upload everything associated with your submission to your forked repository. Make sure to share your forked repository with us before the deadline.** If any part of your submission is an application or service that can be ran, please include instructions for how to run it.
